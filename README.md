# SIH- Hackathon

## Problem Statement
Extraction of crop cycle parameters from multi-temporal data

## Decription
For a given set of multispectral multi-temporal data with timestamp of one year or more, develop and implement an algorithm for extracting crop cycle parameters. Participants need to develop a high-
performance algorithm to analyse multi-temporal data at each pixel to extracting parameters such as date of sowing, date of harvesting and number of harvests based on temporal profile.
